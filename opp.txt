—> OOP :- Object-Oriented Programming
*class
*objects
*encapsulation
*inheritence
*polimorphism
*abstraction

1:- Bottom-Up approach
2:- OOP is inheritance Supports
3:- Code Reusability Supports
4:-Data handling is possible in OOP due to programming.
5:-Using for solving big problems.
6:- Example c++,JAVA,C#,NET

POP :- Procedure Oriented Programming
1:- Top-down approach
2:- POP do not support inheritance 
3:- Cod Reusability Don’t support
4:- It is less secure than OOP
5:- Not suitable for big problems
6:- Example C,FORTRAN
